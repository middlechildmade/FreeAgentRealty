short_description: Bought a Single Family home in 2016 for approximately $250K in Stone Meadows, Madison, WI.
full_description: He was always extremely flexible with the timing of our showings. We always felt very comfortable telling him exactly what we thought. If we didn't like it, he scrapped it immediately. He helped us along the way with each step in regards to paperwork and payments, always checking in to make sure we   were comfortable. If and when we sell/move again, we will without a doubt use him again. Amazingly professional through the entire process.
