short_description: Bought a Condo home in 2016 for approximately $75K in Fitchburg,
  WI.
full_description: Grant did a superb job of taking us through the process. He has
  integrity and professionalism.  At a couple of points he could have pushed for a
  self serving short cut that would have preserved the chance for a quick sale and
  commission, but Grant took the high road, always keeping my interests above his
  own. That is hard to find these days.
