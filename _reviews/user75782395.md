short_description: Bought a Single Family home in 2016 for approximately $175K in
  Eken Park, Madison, WI.
full_description: As first time home buyers, having a realtor that was both patient
  and knowledgeable was very important to us.  Grant led us through the entire process
  and was always willing to answer our (many) questions! He got right to work and
  started scheduling showings as soon as we were ready.  He helped to ensure the closing
  process went smoothly and that we were following all the appropriate steps. There
  were a couple of issues that came up during the home inspection and Grant negotiated
  with the sellers to make sure some items were corrected before the closing.  Grant
  is very friendly and easy to get along with too!  He made searching for homes fun.
  We love our first home but if we ever do decide to move we will definitely give
  Grant a call to help us again.
